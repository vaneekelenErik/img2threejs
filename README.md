## What it does

You give it one reference image of an object — or a **multi-angle set** (separate front/side/back files, or one turnaround sheet) — and it produces a `THREE.Group` factory written in TypeScript that recreates that object from primitives, procedural shaders, and generated geometry — with a runtime hierarchy (pivots, sockets, colliders) so the result is ready to animate, not an inert lump. Multi-angle input improves proportion locks, hidden-side materials, and projection coverage (`grimoire/intake/multi_view_references.md`).

It runs under Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode. It is agent-agnostic: wherever the docs say "agent vision" or "agent browser tool", it uses whatever the host provides — native image reading, a browser MCP, the project preview, or a user-supplied screenshot.

### Subjects and detail accuracy

- **Objects and characters.** Each subject is classified `object`, `character`, or `hybrid`. Objects follow the hard-surface pipeline; characters route through an anatomy-aware track (head-unit proportions, facial landmarks, pose) documented in `grimoire/character/reconstruction.md`.
- **Detail-first analysis.** Before code generation the pipeline enumerates a `detailInventory` of identity-defining small details (gloss, bevel/rounding, screws/rivets, engraved or painted linework, contours, stains and wear). Every detail must map to a real component or material entry, and a strict-quality gate blocks generation until the inventory is complete. Taxonomy: `grimoire/intake/detail_inventory.md`.
- **Maximum likeness for a specific person or character.** An opt-in projection-first path fits a parametric template to image landmarks, de-lights the photo, camera-matches the render, and projects the reference onto the mesh. A single image cannot guarantee 100 percent likeness, so the pipeline reports per-region confidence and asks for more views when it matters. Details: `grimoire/character/likeness_maximization.md`.

---

## How it works

The skill runs a staged sculpting pipeline. Scripts gate each stage; the agent's vision is the only thing that can approve a pass.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Reference image or multi-angle set] --> A2[Package referenceViews]
    A2 --> B[Probe and suitability gate]
    B --> C[Pre-Spec Assessment: class, complexity, quality contract]
    C --> D[Author ObjectSculptSpec: components, materials, sockets]
    D --> E{Validate and strict-quality}
    E -- too shallow --> D
    E -- ok --> F[Locked build passes]
    F --> G[Generate Three.js factory: current pass only]
    G --> H[Render matched viewpoints]
    H --> I[Package one comparison sheet or turnaround grid]
    I --> J{Agent vision review}
    J -- score below threshold --> K[Self-correct: refine-spec or refine-code]
    K --> F
    J -- pass --> L{More passes?}
    L -- yes --> F
    L -- no --> M[Animation-ready Three.js model]
```

### Build passes

The model is sculpted in a fixed order; a pass unlocks only after the previous one is reviewed and accepted:

`blockout → structural-pass → form-refinement → material-pass → surface-pass → lighting-pass → interaction-pass → optimization-pass`

Each pass has its own acceptance criteria. A pass is marked `continue` only with a real render, a comparison sheet, an agent-vision score at or above threshold, and every identity-defining feature at or above its own threshold.

### The gates

- **Suitability** — is the image a viable 3D target at all.
- **Pre-spec and strict-quality** — blocks code generation until the spec is deep enough for the object's complexity (no single-root spec for a compound object).
- **Screenshot feedback** — `continue` requires a render plus a comparison sheet plus a passing vision score.
- **Action-ready** — the model exposes a runtime hierarchy (pivots, sockets, colliders, destruction groups) via `root.userData.sculptRuntime`.
- **Attachment correctness** — child parts (handles, limbs, tubes) declare how they join their parent, so nothing floats in mid-air.
- **Material and lighting realism** — independent PBR channels and real lights, never albedo aliased into roughness.

### Self-correction

After every pass the agent chooses exactly one action: `continue`, `refine-spec`, `refine-code`, `request-input`, or `stop`. `refine-spec` fixes a wrong or shallow spec and re-validates; `refine-code` fixes geometry, material, or lighting that does not match a sound spec.

## Quick start

1. **Install**

   - **Cursor (this repo):** already wired as a project skill at `.cursor/skills/img2threejs/`. Open a **new** Agent chat and type `/img2threejs`.
   - **Claude Code / global:** place the folder in your skills directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoainho/img2threejs.git ~/.claude/skills/img2threejs
   # Cursor global alternative:
   # ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.cursor/skills/img2threejs
   ```

2. **Invoke** — in Cursor Agent or Claude Code, attach or point to an object image and run:

   ```
   /img2threejs Rebuild this object as a Three.js model, keep the proportions, angles, and colours.
   ```

   If `/img2threejs` does not appear in a Cloud Agent slash menu, attach the image and ask: “Use the img2threejs skill (`.cursor/skills/img2threejs`) …” — or `@` the skill / root `SKILL.md`.

3. **Follow the pipeline** — the skill validates the image, writes an assessment and spec, generates the factory pass by pass, and shows you a side-by-side comparison at each step until the render matches.

The scripts run from the skill root and need only Python 3.10+ — nothing to install.

```bash
python3 forge/stage1_intake/probe_image.py <image>
# optional multi-angle packaging (separate files or one turnaround sheet):
# python3 forge/stage1_intake/slice_reference_views.py sheet.png --layout row-3 --out-dir views/ --out views.json
# python3 forge/stage1_intake/slice_reference_views.py --view front=a.png --view side=b.png --out views.json
python3 forge/stage2_spec/new_pre_spec_assessment.py "Name" --image <image> --out assessment.json
python3 forge/stage2_spec/new_sculpt_spec.py "Name" --image <image> --assessment assessment.json --out spec.json
python3 forge/stage2_spec/validate_sculpt_spec.py spec.json --strict-quality
python3 forge/stage3_build/generate_threejs_factory.py spec.json --out src/createObjectModel.ts
```

## Why it is token-efficient

Most image-to-3D agent loops burn tokens by asking the model to do mechanical work — re-reading the whole model every pass, scoring pixels, validating JSON by hand, re-running steps it already did. img2threejs pushes all of that into deterministic scripts and spends model tokens only where judgment is actually required.

- **Scripts enforce, the model judges.** The Python scripts handle validation, gating, spec authoring, PBR extraction, comparison-sheet packaging, and pipeline state. They never score visuals. The model's tokens go to one thing: looking at a single side-by-side sheet and deciding pass or fail.
- **Zero dependencies, zero install churn.** Every script is pure Python 3.10+ standard library. No pip, no PIL, no numpy, no Playwright. PNG read/write is done with `struct` and `zlib`. Nothing to install means nothing to debug in-context.
- **Pass-gated generation.** The code generator emits only the currently unlocked build pass. The model does not regenerate or re-read the entire model on every iteration — each step is small and scoped.
- **Fail fast, before codegen.** A strict-quality gate blocks shallow specs before a single line of Three.js is generated, so you never spend tokens rendering a model that was underspecified from the start.
- **One image per review.** Each pass is judged from exactly one packaged comparison sheet (reference beside render), not a scattering of screenshots.
- **Text output, not binaries.** The result is diffable TypeScript plus a JSON spec — small, reviewable, and version-controllable, instead of multi-megabyte mesh files.

The net effect: you still get a faithful 3D model from an image, but the expensive model context is reserved for visual judgment and code, not bookkeeping. For the full per-stage and per-cycle token breakdown, see [docs/TOKEN_COST.md](docs/TOKEN_COST.md).

| `stage2_spec/new_sculpt_spec.py` | Author the ObjectSculptSpec from the assessment. |
| `stage2_spec/validate_sculpt_spec.py` | Validate the spec; `--strict-quality` blocks shallow specs before codegen. |
| `stage1_intake/extract_pbr_evidence.py` | Reference-derived PBR evidence per crop (inference, not inverse rendering). |
| `stage3_build/orchestrate_passes.py` | Locked pass state: status, check, sync. |
| `stage3_build/generate_threejs_factory.py` | Emit the Three.js `Group` factory for the current unlocked pass. |
| `stage4_review/make_comparison_sheet.py` | Package one reference-vs-render sheet (or multi-view turnaround grid) for review. |
| `stage4_review/append_review.py` | Record a per-pass review: scores, decision, evidence. |
| `_shared/feature_acceptance_policy.py` | Internal helper enforcing per-feature score thresholds. |
| `stage1_intake/build_detail_inventory.py` | Slice the reference into zones and scaffold a detail inventory. |
| `stage1_intake/extract_landmarks.py` | Overlay a landmark grid and scaffold an anatomy block for characters. |
| `stage1_intake/solve_camera_pose.py` | Emit a reference-camera block so the render can be camera-matched. |
| `stage1_intake/delight_albedo.py` | Approximate a neutral albedo from the photo before texture projection. |
| `stage3_build/bake_projected_texture.py` | Emit a projection/UV-bake descriptor for photo-texture projection. |

The `grimoire/` folder holds the detailed rubrics each gate applies (validation, pre-spec assessment, procedural patterns, material and lighting realism, attachment correctness, action-ready models, self-correction).

## Honesty about limits

A single image cannot reveal hidden sides or guarantee exact geometry. Prefer a multi-angle set (or a turnaround sheet) when fidelity matters — the pipeline packages those as `referenceViews` and reviews matched angles. With only one view, the skill states plainly when output is approximate, stylized, or low-poly, and infers unseen faces by mirroring visible ones rather than faking confidence. It is strong for hard-surface objects; characters are stylized reconstructions, not photoreal likeness. "This cannot reach the requested fidelity from this image" is a valid, expected result.
